I think keeping mental health at the forefront of our minds, especially in 2020 but probably beyond, as something that is classified as the same kind of ""necessary day off"" as being physically ill is important. Beating employees over the head (metaphorically) with resources they can use and continuing to broadcast success stories from either brave self-identifying folks or anonymous folks de-mystifies the problem and may motivate others to see that there is support and ""a way forward"" rather than suffering and potentially unhealthy coping reinforced by a culture of ""dealing with it yourself"".",,1,26,male,United States of America,Massachusetts,White,,United States of America,Massachusetts,,,,

Billable hours and timesheets are a false and pointless dataset. Work life balance is a sham. Flexibility is a double edged sword. 8 hour work days are arbitrary inventions with a history steeped in human rights movements to prevent capitalist abuse, not grounded in science or a sense of productivity or purpose. Time management and productivity hacking is all a traffic driving click bait farce. We should be adopting target driven business and staff management/ reporting approaches (which hopefully I'll get to build for one day if I don't kill myself first...). We are humans. We are messy and broken and that's supposed to be what makes life glorious, but instead of just quietly pursuing ""enough"", we're chained to our desks in an effort to protect our families well being in a sycophantic attempt to grab the proverbial dangled carrot from whoever sits above us in the food chain, who yells down  ""ENOUGH is just a little bit more"". Personally, I'd rather be dead, but I've got mouths to feed...",,1,31,male,South Africa,,,,South Africa,,,,,

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",,FALSE,42,Male,United States of America,Florida,White,United States of America,Florida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
